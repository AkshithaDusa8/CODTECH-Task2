Overview of the Project:

Project: To create a Weather Forecast app using HTML, CSS, JS.

Structure of the Weather Forecast App:

    HTML Structure: Provides a basic layout with a form to input city names and a container to display weather information (<div id="weather-info">).

    CSS Styling: Styles elements to create a visually appealing and responsive interface, focusing on simplicity and clarity.

    JavaScript Functionality:
        Event Handling: Listens for form submission (form.addEventListener('submit', ...)).
        API Integration: Uses the fetch API to retrieve weather data from OpenWeatherMap based on the user-provided city.
        Error Handling: Manages errors if the city is not found or if there's an issue with fetching data.
        Displaying Weather: Updates the DOM dynamically with weather information such as city name, temperature, and description.

Key Features:

    Search: Users can input a city name to retrieve current weather data.
    Dynamic Updates: Weather information is fetched and displayed dynamically without refreshing the page.
    Error Handling: Provides feedback if the city is not found or if there's an issue with the API request.

Further Enhancements:

    Unit Conversion: Allow users to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
    Extended Forecast: Display a forecast for the upcoming days.
    Geolocation: Use the browser's geolocation API to get weather based on the user's current location.

This basic weather forecast application serves as a foundation for further customization and enhancement based on specific requirements and additional API features.
